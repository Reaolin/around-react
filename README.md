**Intro**

This is a project about taking pictures and creating a personal profile for yourself. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This project is able to switch sizes and proportions depending on which screen/device you are viewing it from.  I obtained all design specifications from a Figma site.  I created different branches in Github depending on what I was working on and merged them back into the master and gh-pages. I utilized both display: grid and dispay: flex properties depending on the need and screen size. I downloaded and imported the 'Inter' fonts family. We also enable the use of Buttons in JavaScript. Implemented functionality for closing modal windows with the 'esc' key and clicking outside of the modal window. We recently have used Webpack to configure our project for deployment.  Now we are in the process of porting our project over into React.  This is the first iteration of porting into React.
